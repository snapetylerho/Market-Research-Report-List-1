<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Dilatation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Compliant Type</li><li>Non-Compliant Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTCA dilatation catheters are used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures to expand narrowed coronary arteries. The semi-compliant type allows for some balloon expansion under lower pressures, accommodating softer lesions while maintaining vessel integrity. In contrast, the non-compliant type provides minimal expansion at lower pressures but delivers higher pressures for precise lesion dilation, making it ideal for rigid or heavily calcified lesions. Both types are crucial for tailored treatments in coronary interventions, addressing varying patient needs effectively.</p></p>
